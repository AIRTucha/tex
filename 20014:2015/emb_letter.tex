Dear Madam, Sir,\\\\
%intro
I am a student of Savonia UAS, Kuopio, my field of study is an Information Technologies.\\\\
My bachelor degree program include summer internships and now I am looking for it. \\\\
I am interested in GUI\footnote{JavaScript, Java Swing, Android Development} and game\footnote{Unity3D} development. Also I have had an experience in SQL databases\footnote{T-SQL, PL/SQL, Postgres SQL and MicrosoftSQL Servers}, digital signal processing, artificial intelligent for games and control engineering. My first programming language is C, so I fond of C like programming languages: C++, Java, C\# and JavaScript. Right now I am learning JavaScript's framework D3.js\footnote{Data-Driven Documents} by myself, because in future I am going to get Master Degree in Data Science and Data Visualization is one of the main fields of Data Science.\\\\
Right now, I am tacking part in Erasmus+ exchange program and this part of the studying year I am going to study at Institute of Technology Tralee, Ireland. I will learn Computer Service Management, System Architecture, Visual Communication, Big Data\footnote{R, Hadoop} and Game Mechanics\footnote{Game development on Unity3D engine}, here. I also will have an opportunity to improve my English by native speakers surrounding. \\\\
In childhood I studied Visual Art for 6 years, so I am able to draw, also I am familiar with Adobe Photoshop and Illustrator.\\\\
My hobby is photography\footnote{you can find my photos here facebook.com/airtucha} and raster / vector graphics. \\\\

I think that every person which I meet during my life can teach me something. The internship in German is a good chance for me to get to know a lot of new people with different from mine cultural backgrounds, habits and lifestyles. I think I will have an opportunity to learn a lot during the internship and my learning will be not only connected with field of study. For sure the internship will change my point of view a lot. It will make me more open mind person and better specialist.\\\\
Thank you for spending your time and reading my cover letter.\\\\
