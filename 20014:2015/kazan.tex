%MAIN CONTENT ******************************************************************************************************************
Dear Madam, Sir,\\\\
%intro
I am student of Savonia University of Applied Sciences. I decided to apply for the 3-4 year Bachelor program at Innopolis University because I am very interested in your program about Artificial Intelligence. It will mean a lot for me and my future career prospectives.\\\\
%about IT
State language in Finland is Finnish, but my studying program in Savonia UAS is in English and I also took part in an exchange program Erasmus+. This part of the studying year I spend in Institute of Technology in Tralee, Ireland. Right now I am learning Project Management, System Architecture, Game Mechanics(Game Development with Unity and C\#/JavaScript) and Big Data(R, Hadoop) in Ireland. So studying in English is not problem for me.(Actually it is preferable because it is even easier for me to understand scientific information about math, physics and computer sciences in English.)\\\\
I also want to apply at Innopolis because I am very exited by your teachers team, facilities, equipment and subjects set, which are up to the best Universities of Europe or even the World. \\\\
Three years ago I left my Home country to get an European level education and improve my English, but now I am very happy to have a chance to come back home for even more superb opportunities.\\\\
In addition, I was born far away from Kazan in Karelia Republic, Russia is very big country and I have never been at this part of Russia, but it would be very interesting for me to make myself familiar with the culture and nature of Tatarstan Republic.\\\\
Moreover, Innopolis has truly international student's community, it is excellent chance to find a lot of new friends all over the world and spread my network of acquaintances. It s can be very useful in the business field. I think that every person which I meet during my life can teach me something. Studying in Innopolis is a good chance for me to get to know a lot of new people with different cultural backgrounds, habits and lifestyles. \\\\
%Ending
I would really appreciate if you considered my application and gave me the chance to participate in the Bachelor program at Innopolis University. This experience would be a great motivation for me, it would change my life and make me more confident. \\\\
%Thanks
Thank you for spending your time and reading my motivation letter.
