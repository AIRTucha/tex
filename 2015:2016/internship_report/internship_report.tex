\section{Company}

I have got my summer practice at Institute of Data Processing and Electronics, which belonges to the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT). The organisation's visitor address is Hermann-von-Helmholtz-Platz 1, 76344 Eggenstein-Leopoldshafen, Germany and mailing address is Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT) - Campus North, Institute for Data Processing and Electronics (IPE), P.O. Box 3640, 76021, Karlsruhe, Germany. The phone number is +49 721 608 2 2027, an e-mail address is info@ipe.kit.edu, ipe.kit.edu is the webpage of the organisation. I worked under supervision of Dr. Torsten Hopp, his e-mail address is torsten.hopp@kit.edu and the phone number is +49 721 608-25990. The internship period is from the 7th of July to the 18th of November.

\subsection{General Information}

Karlsruhe Institute of Technology is one of the larges research and education organisation in Germany. In 2009, University of Karlsruhe\footnote{Founded in 1825} merged with Karlsruhe Research Center Forschungszentrum Karlsruhe\footnote{Based on national nuclear research center opened in 1956 and called Kernforschungszentrum Karlsruhe, or KfK}. The institute has leadership in the Engineering and Natural Sciences in Europe, ranking sixth overall in citation impact.\\

The total budget of KIT \euro 844 million, the total number of stuff is over 10 thousands and over 7 thousands of them is academic stuff. There are 24.5 thousands of studetns, 12.6 thousands of them are undergraduates ones, 8,3 thousands are postgraduete and over 8 hundreds are doctor studets.
\subsection{Stuff}

I was a part of 3D USCT team. USCT and Big Data together form the Software Methods groupe of IPE. The Head of Software Methods groupe is Dr. Rainer Stotzka. The permanent part of USCT team consists of:  
\begin{itemize}
\item Dr. Nicole Ruiter - the head of 3D USCT
\item Dr. Torsten Hopp - responsable for image processing and data management
\item Michael Zapf - responsable for hardware and public relations
\item Prof. Dr. Hartmut Gemmeke - former head of IPE, Advisor of 3D USCT
\end{itemize}

Other teammembers are students who are doing internship or writing thesis at the institute.

\subsection{History}

\subsection{KIT History}

A polytechnical school of Karlsruhe was founded on the 7th of October 1825. In 1865, the schooles was raised to the status of an institution of higher education. Since 1885 the organisation was called institute of technology. Karlsruhe Nuclear Research Centre was opedned in 1956. In 1967, it started to be called University. \\

University of Karlsruhe opened the a central computer laboratory and become one of the leading German institutions in computer science, in 1966. As I already noticed, Karlsruhe Research Centre and Karlsruhe Institute of Technology merged toghere at 1 October 2009.
