%MAIN CONTENT ******************************************************************************************************************
Dear Madam, Sir,\\\\
%intro
I am student of Savonia University of Applied Sciences and my University takes part in the Erasmus+ exchange program, that's why I have a brilliant opportunity to apply for the exchange programme at the Tralee Institute of Technology. It will mean a lot for me and my future career prospectives.\\\\
%about IT
My field of studying is information technology and I know that your Institute\footnote{I have the feedback form my friend who is studying there now} has an excellent program connected with it, I think I would able to get a lot of useful knowledge and skills during my studying in Tralle Institute of Technology. I also know that now Ireland is one of the most significant players in the Information Technology industry in Europe, the European head offices of the biggest high-tech companies, like Google and Microsoft, are placed in this country, which makes it attractive to me. In addition, I am very interested in the content of your courses:
\begin{itemize}
\item System Architecture,
\item Security and Cryptography,
\item Big Data,
\item IT Service Management, 
\item Software Quality Management.
\end{itemize}
%about English
Studying in Ireland would give me a good opportunity to improve my English language skills. The exchange would bring me closer to the Irish culture, which I respect and admire. I would get the understanding of the Irish lifestyle, their habits, beliefs and values. \\\\
%about Nature
I find Irish nature and architecture really fascinating\footnote{only by photos yet} because it is totally different from the ones of Karelia\footnote{the part of Russia where I was born} and Finland\footnote{there I am studying now}. It is worth mentioning that my hobby is landscape and portrait\href{https://www.facebook.com/airtucha/media_set?set=a.1404921599747323.1073741829.100006884891507&type=3}{photography}, that is why Ireland is a perfect place for taking beautiful pictures of beautiful people. I have been thinking of starting a traveller's blog in order to share my views on different countries, and Ireland would be the first on my list.\\\\
%about friends
In addition, the exchange is also an excellent chance to find a lot of new friends all over the world. The network of acquaintances can be very useful in the business field. I think that every person which I meet during my life can teach me something. Studying in Tralee is a good chance for me to get to know a lot of new people with different cultural backgrounds, habits and lifestyles. \\\\
%Ending
I would really appreciate if you considered my application and gave me the chance to participate in the Erasmus+ programme at Tralee Institute of Technology. This experience would be a great motivation for me, it would change my life and make me more confident. \\\\
%Thanks
Thank you for spending your time and reading my motivation letter.
