%MAIN CONTENT ******************************************************************************************************************

My name is Alexey Tukalo, I am student of Savonia University of Applied Sciences, Finland. I arrived in Karlsruhe on the start of July to have an internship in KIT IPE.\\\\
My internship runs until middle of November. I want to inform German Police that I was deceived when I looked for an accommodation for last two weeks at Karlsruhe.\\\\

I tried to find an accommodation via ads posted on the website - http://www.wg-gesucht.de as I did before and after two weeks of research I received reply from Jennifer Dora Klaus\footnote{woleukure@gmail.com}.
\begin{figure}[H]

\end{figure}
 The reply have had same topic as typical reply for an application to wg-gesucht.de. Jennifer told me that she is in India and that she has a flat\footnote{two room flat, Welckerstra√üe 4,76131 Karlsruhe} in Karlsruhe(fig.2).\\\\
\begin{figure}[H]

\end{figure}

After some negotiations we agreed that I will rent the flat from her for two weeks\footnote{from the 1st to the 15th of November} for 200\euro, we signed contract and I transferred her money via Western Union. I was in a hurry, because I was really afraid that the delivery would not be on time and decided to transfer the money on my own risk.

\end{figure}

After that she replied me that she received money and provided me tracking number of the parcel with the key. She also noticed that there is some problems with DHL in India, so she used some other delivery company and provided me the website\footnote{http://amazingexpressco.com} there I can track the parcel.\\\\

\end{figure}

One of my colleague\footnote{Pranita Pradhan} also looked for an accommodation, so I provided her the Jennifer's e-mail address and they agreed that Pranita would rent the flat when I would leave. I told her that she don't have to transfer money until I would get key.\\\\

But Jennifer found some way to force Pranita to transfer the money to her. After that we decided to check if anybody knows the person at the building and the result was negative, I requested an explanation from Jennifer, but did not get any response. So, we started to worry, but we was not able to do anything until the parcel would arrive.\\\\

\end{figure}

In according with the tracking information I had to receive\footnote{I asked her to send the key to Joel Bauer, because I sublease room from the guy and the room doesn't have number, there is only the owner name on the mail box} the key at the 26th October at 6:30p.m, but nothing arrived. After that we carefully check the website of the delivery company and come up with an idea that it is fake.\\\\

I also have check automatic replies from wg-gesucht and found that I did not apply for any flat which belongs to Jennifer. Pranita also told me that she received "brand-new" email from Jennifer and the email is 100\% same with the one she wrote to me and another colleague of us also received same one. So, nobody of us applied for the flat, but all of us get response about it. It seems to be that our email address were tracked some there in wg-gesucht, in my point of view it can be explained in two possible ways:\\

\begin{enumerate}
\item Maybe the wg-gesucht data base is hacked, it sounds crazy, but the guys created fake website for delivery company, so they should be somehow related with software engineering and networking.
\item But more probably they have a fake account on wg-gesucht, but the fake account is registered to the other person and address, because if it would belong to Jennifer Dora Klaus and ad would be compromised and blocked soon.
\end{enumerate}

I understand that it is not big enough problem to trouble Police, but I will be very thankful if you will take my statement in consideration. I hope it will be helpful if more people will come trapped by the schema. I want to take in serious consideration that Jennifer Dora Klaus exist, because in other case they will not be able to get money from WU.\\\

I think that it can probably save money to somebody if police is able to block the fake delivery website in German.\\
