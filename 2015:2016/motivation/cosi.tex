Dear Madam, Sir,\\ 

Graduating from Bachelor of Information Technology I am looking for an opportunity to continue my education at Master level from the next Autumn. With this letter I hereby wish to state my interest and apply for Erasmus Mundus Joint Master Degree (EMJMD) programme in 3D Multimedia Technology, because I have never benefited from an Erasmus Mundus Master Course grant.\\

In my opinion, this kind of travel can be an interesting challenge. However, I am sure I am able to handle it, since I have a sufficient experience of studying and working abroad. In addition, I am very impressed by the mobility structure of the program, it seems to be it is an amazing chance to meet a lot of people with totally different cultural backgrounds, lifestyles and habits. In my point of view every person which I meet during my life can teach me something useful. It is worth mentioning that my hobby is a landscape, street and portrait photography\footnote{500px.com/alexeytukalo}, thatâ€™s why I am especially impressed by the program, it would give me a possibility to take a large number of photos of new people from a various number of places around Europe. I think that the experience in visual art and understanding of computer science give me an opportunity to reach quite good results at the art.\\

My passion to the visual art started in childhood when I went to the art school, at that time I used to dream to become an architecture, industrial designer or web-designer later. But I am also very good at Math and Computer Science, that was the reason of applying for Bachelor Degree in Information Technology in Finland with tuition in English. Moreover, I took a part in an Erasmus+ Exchange programme in Ireland for one semester. In Ireland I had got my first experience in data visualisation. I found perfect balance between my interest to the visual art with knowledge on computer science in this field.\\

Right after that I was hired by Karlsruhe Institute of Technology as an intern where I worked at Institute of Data Processing and Electronics for more than 4 months\footnote{Reference from Dr. Hopp}. The project was related with development of a device for an early diagnostics of the breast cancer. The most part of the work placement I did image processing with Java. The visual experience and knowledge of colour models learned from photography helped me a lot. I also developed promo website for the project based on WebGL implementation of my algorithm integrated into the volume rendering library developed by KIT\footnote{ipepc57.ipe.kit.edu:10002}. The algorithm is used in a clinical studies and I am mentioned as co-author of an article published in a peer review journal about medicine. The experience of data visualisation and digital image processing gained in Germany has contributed to get a job at Arction Oy, Finland. I am also doing a my final thesis project in collaboration with this company\footnote{Implementation of volume rendering in Arction's C\# framework for visualisation of scientific data}. As you can see the most part of my professional experience is related with medical image processing and visualisation of medical data, so obviously the specialisation in Applied Colour Imaging is the most suitable for me.\\

Besides, my knowledge in computer science and visual art, I am well organised person, I really like to organise my own work and work of my teammates. I always try to improve my leadership skills and gain more experience in project management, it was the main reason why I joined Pricelizer team\footnote{Reference from Karl Lillrud}. In Pricelizer I got a lot of experience in term of management of IT project for team distributed around the world.\\

%Ending
Please, consider me as a potential candidate to Erasmus Mundus Joint Master Degree (EMJMD) programme in 3D Multimedia Technology and Erasmus+ Joint Master Degree scholarship. I believe that this programme will have a great value in my career prospects. This experience will be a huge motivation for me to bring new ideas to the industry. \\


Thank you in advance.\\
Yours faithfully,\\
Alexey Tukalo
