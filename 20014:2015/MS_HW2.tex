\section{Company name}
 I think, that the good name for this kind of company is Partyent LLC, the name is mix of two words: party and patient. I want point my client that our company is "just what the doctor ordered" for people who want to have a party.
\section{Vision Statement}
 I will prefer to combine vertical and horizontal scaling at the same time, but of course 4 years is not long period of time for this kind of business. In my point of view the most realistic perspective is work with representatives of local Variety, organisation of some more serious event for busyness and the expansion of the influence zone to nearest cites.
\section{Business Value}
The one of the main values of our company is network of contact in field of entertainment and parters(restaurants and so on). We are focused on organisation of student's parties that's why we are trying to keep our team quite young to have better understanding of our clients. In other hand our young team is somehow inexperienced, it results we can keep average salary relatively low and as result low price, because price is always vary important for students.
