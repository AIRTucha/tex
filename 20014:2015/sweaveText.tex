\title{An Sweave Demo}
\author{Charles J. Geyer}
\maketitle

This is a demo for using the \verb@Sweave@ command in R.  To
get started make a regular \LaTeX\ file (like this one) but
give it the suffix \verb@.Rnw@ instead of \verb@.tex@ and then
turn it into a \LaTeX\ file (\verb@foo.tex@) with the (unix) command
\begin{verbatim}
R CMD Sweave foo.Rnw
\end{verbatim}
So you can do
\begin{verbatim}
latex foo
xdvi foo
\end{verbatim}
and so forth.

So now we have a more complicated file chain
$$
\begin{CD}
   \texttt{foo.Rnw}
   @>\texttt{Sweave}>>
   \texttt{foo.tex}
   @>\texttt{latex}>>
   \texttt{foo.dvi}
   @>\texttt{xdvi}>>
   \text{view of document}
\end{CD}
$$
and what have we accomplished other than making it twice as annoying
to the WYSIWYG crowd (having to run both \verb@Sweave@ and \verb@latex@
to get anything that looks like the document)?

Well, we can now include R in our document.  Here's a simple example
\begin{Schunk}
\begin{Sinput}
> 2 + 2
\end{Sinput}
\begin{Soutput}
[1] 4
\end{Soutput}
\end{Schunk}
What I actually typed in \verb@foo.Rnw@ was
\begin{tabbing}
\verb@<<two>>=@ \\
\verb@2 + 2@ \\
\verb+@+ \\
\end{tabbing}
This is not \LaTeX.  It is a ``code chunk'' to be processed by \verb@Sweave@.
When \verb@Sweave@ hits such a thing, it processes it, runs R to get the
results, and stuffs (by default) the output in the \LaTeX\ file it is
creating.  The \LaTeX\ between code chunks is copied verbatim (except
for \verb@Sexpr@, about which see below).  Hence to create a Rnw document
you just write plain old \LaTeX\ interspersed with ``code chunks'' which
are plain old R.

Plots get a little more complicated.  First we make something to plot
(simulate regression data).
\begin{Schunk}
\begin{Sinput}
> n <- 50
> x <- seq(1, n)
> a.true <- 3
> b.true <- 1.5
> y.true <- a.true + b.true * x
> s.true <- 17.3
> y <- y.true + s.true * rnorm(n)
> out1 <- lm(y ~ x)
> summary(out1)
\end{Sinput}
\begin{Soutput}
Call:
lm(formula = y ~ x)

\end{Soutput}
\end{Schunk}
(for once we won't show the code chunk itself, look at \verb@foo.Rnw@
if you want to see what the actual code chunk was).

Figure~\ref{fig:one} (p.~\pageref{fig:one})
is produced by the following code
\begin{Schunk}
\begin{Sinput}
> plot(x, y)
> abline(out1)
\end{Sinput}
\end{Schunk}
\begin{figure}
\begin{center}
\includegraphics{sweaveText-fig1}
\end{center}
\caption{Scatter Plot with Regression Line}
\label{fig:one}
\end{figure}
Note that \verb@x@, \verb@y@, and \verb@out1@ are remembered from
the preceding code chunk.  We don't have to regenerate them.
All code chunks are part of one R ``session''.

Now this was a little tricky.  We did this with two code chunks,
one visible and one invisible.  First we did
\begin{tabbing}
\verb@<<label=fig1plot,include=FALSE>>=@ \\
\verb@plot(x, y)@ \\
\verb@abline(out1)@ \\
\verb+@+
\end{tabbing}
where the \verb@include=FALSE@ indicates that the output (text and graphics)
should not go here (they will be some place else) and the \verb@label=fig1plot@
gives the code chunk a name (to be used later).  And ``later'' is almost
immediate.  Next we did
\begin{tabbing}
\verb@\begin{figure}@ \\
\verb@\begin{center}@ \\
\verb@<<label=fig1,fig=TRUE,echo=FALSE>>=@ \\
\verb@<<fig1plot>>@ \\
\verb+@+ \\
\verb@\end{center}@ \\
\verb@\caption{Scatter Plot with Regression Line}@ \\
\verb@\label{fig:one}@ \\
\verb@\end{figure}@
\end{tabbing}
In this code chunk the \verb@fig=TRUE@ indicates that the chunk
generates a figure.  \verb@Sweave@ automagically makes both EPS and PDF
files for the figure and automagically generates an
appropriate \LaTeX\ \verb@\includegraphics@ command
to include the plot in the \verb@figure@ environment.
The \verb@echo=FALSE@ in the code chunk means just what it says
(we've already seen the code---it was produced by the preceding chunk---and
we don't want to see it again, especially not in our figure).
The \verb@<<fig1plot>>@ is an example of ``code chunk reuse''.
It means that we reuse the code of the code chunk named \verb@fig1plot@.
It is important that we observe the DRY/SPOT rule (\emph{don't repeat yourself}
or \emph{single point of truth}) and only have one bit of code for generating
the plot.  What the reader sees is guaranteed to be the code that made the
plot.  If we had used cut-and-paste, just repeating the code, the duplicated
code might get out of sync after edits.
The rest of this should be recognizable to anyone who has ever
done a \LaTeX\ figure.

So making a figure is a bit more complicated in some ways but much simpler
in others.  Note the following virtues
\begin{itemize}
\item The figure is guaranteed to be the one described by the text
(at least by the R in the text).
\item No messing around with sizing or rotations.  It just works!
\end{itemize}

\begin{figure}
\begin{center}
\includegraphics{sweaveText-fig2}
\end{center}
\caption{Scatter Plot with Cubic Regression Curve}
\label{fig:two}
\end{figure}
Note that if you don't care to show the R code to make the figure,
it is simpler still.  Figure~\ref{fig:two} (p.~\pageref{fig:two})
shows another plot.
What I actually typed in \verb@foo.Rnw@ was
\begin{tabbing}
\verb@\begin{figure}@ \\
\verb@\begin{center}@ \\
\verb@<<label=fig2,fig=TRUE,echo=FALSE>>=@ \\
\verb@out3 <- lm(y ~ x + I(x^2) + I(x^3))@ \\
\verb@plot(x, y)@ \\
\verb@curve(predict(out3, newdata=data.frame(x=x)), add = TRUE)@ \\
\verb+@+ \\
\verb@\end{center}@ \\
\verb@\caption{Scatter Plot with Cubic Regression Curve}@ \\
\verb@\label{fig:two}@ \\
\verb@\end{figure}@
\end{tabbing}
Now we just included the code for the plot in the figure
(with \verb@echo=FALSE@ so it doesn't show).

Also note that every time we rerun \verb@Sweave@ Figures~\ref{fig:one}
and~\ref{fig:two} change, the latter conspicuously (because the simulated
data are random).  Everything
just works.  This should tell you the main virtue of Sweave.
It's always correct.  There is never a problem with stale
cut-and-paste.

Simple numbers can be plugged into the text with the \verb@\Sexpr@
command, for example, the quadratic and cubic regression coefficients
in the preceding regression were
$\beta_2 = 0.0565$
and
$\beta_3 = -0.0005$.
Just magic!
What I actually typed in \verb@foo.Rnw@ was
\begin{tabbing}
\verb@in the preceding regression@ \\
\verb@were $\beta_2 = \Se@\verb@xpr{round(out3$coef[3], 4)}$@ \\
\verb@and $\beta_3 = \Se@\verb@xpr{round(out3$coef[4], 4)}$.@
\end{tabbing}

The \verb@xtable@ command is used to make tables.  (The following
is the \verb@Sweave@ of another code chunk that we don't explicitly
show.  Look at \verb@foo.Rnw@ for details.)
\begin{Schunk}
\begin{Sinput}
> out2 <- lm(y ~ x + I(x^2))
> foo <- anova(out1, out2, out3)
> foo
\end{Sinput}
\begin{Soutput}

\begin{Sinput}

\end{Sinput}
\begin{Soutput}

\end{Soutput}
\begin{Sinput}

> foo
\end{Sinput}
\begin{Soutput}
  Res.Df      RSS Df Sum of Sq         F    Pr(>F)

\end{Soutput}
\end{Schunk}
So now we are ready to turn the matrix \verb@foo@
into Table~\ref{tab:one}
